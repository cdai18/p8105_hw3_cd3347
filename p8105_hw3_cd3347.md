### Problem 1

Loading the instacart data:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains information from the grocery delivery service
Instacart. Customers can enlist a shopper, employed by Instacart, to do
their grocery shopping for them at various grocery stores in their area.
The shopper will then deliver the groceries to their door. There are
`nrow(instacart)` rows and `ncol(instacart)` columns total. In this
dataset, each observation corresponds to a specific product and includes
information such as `product_name`, `aisle`, `department`, and
`days_since_prior_order`. For example, the first row in the dataset is
Bulgarian Yogurt in the dairy and eggs department in the yogurt aisle.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                          n_obs
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

There are 134 different aisles in the data and the most items are
ordered from the fresh vegetables and fresh fruits aisles. These two
aisles had nearly twice as many orders than the 3rd most ordered from
aisle, which was packaged vegetables and fruits.

Make a plot for `aisles`:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_obs > 10000) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_obs)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cd3347_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”:

``` r
aisles_pop = 
  instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
    group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
    summarize(n_prod = n()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n_prod)) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

Table for hour of day Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered
for each day of the week:

``` r
apples_coffee = 
  instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow, order_hour_of_day)
```

### Problem 2

Loading the BRFSS data:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Data cleaning:

``` r
brfss_clean = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, state_county = locationdesc) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" | response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | response == "Poor") %>% 
  mutate(response = as.factor(response)) %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
locations2002 = 
  brfss_clean %>% 
    group_by(state) %>% 
    filter(year == 2002) %>% 
    summarize(n_counties = n_distinct(state_county)) %>% 
    filter(n_counties >= 7)
```

``` r
locations2010 = 
  brfss_clean %>% 
    group_by(state) %>% 
    filter(year == 2010) %>% 
    summarize(n_counties = n_distinct(state_county)) %>% 
    filter(n_counties >= 7)
```

In 2002, CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, and WA were
observed at 7 or more locations.

In 2010, CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, and PA were observed at 7 or more
locations.

Spaghetti plot:

Modifying the data

``` r
excellent = 
  brfss_clean %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent")
```
